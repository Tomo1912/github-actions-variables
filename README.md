# CI Pipeline Demonstration

Welcome to my GitHub Actions demo repository! This project showcases a well-structured Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using GitHub Actions. Below, I’ll walk you through what this workflow does, how it’s set up, and why I designed it this way—perfect for anyone exploring my GitHub profile to see my skills in action!

## What This Repository Does

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the build and test process for a sample application. It’s a demonstration of how I approach CI pipelines to ensure code quality and reliability in real-world projects.

## The Workflow: CI Pipeline Demonstration

The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci-demo.yml`. Here’s what it does:

### Triggers
- **Runs on**:  
  - Push events to `main` or `develop` branches  
  - Pull requests targeting the `main` branch  
- **Why**: This ensures the pipeline runs automatically whenever code is updated or reviewed, catching issues early.

### Environment
- **Runner**: `ubuntu-latest` (a cost-effective, widely-used Linux environment)  
- **Variables**:  
  - `ACCESS_ID`: A secure credential stored in GitHub Secrets  
  - `NODE_VERSION`: Set to 18 for consistent Node.js builds  
- **Why**: Using secrets keeps sensitive data safe, and version pinning ensures reproducibility.

### Steps
1. **Checkout Repository**: Pulls the latest code using `actions/checkout@v4`.  
2. **Setup Node.js**: Configures Node.js (v18) with dependency caching for faster runs.  
3. **Install Dependencies**: Uses `npm ci` for a clean, repeatable install.  
4. **Display Access ID**: Shows how to securely use environment variables.  
5. **Run Tests**: Executes `npm test` (with a fallback message if no tests exist).  
6. **Debug on Failure**: If anything fails, it prints environment details for troubleshooting.  
- **Why**: These steps mimic a real CI process—code retrieval, environment setup, dependency management, testing, and debugging.

## Why This Matters
 
- **Automate Processes**: Streamline development with CI.  
- **Handle Security**: Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data.  
- **Write Maintainable Code**: Structure workflows with clear steps and error handling.  
- **Think Practically**: Include debugging and fallback mechanisms.
